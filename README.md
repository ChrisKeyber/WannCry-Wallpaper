Setting introduction
=
__Other settings__

**Enable window:** Close / Open the WannaCry window
(Clicking the close button on the right hand corner of the window also work)

**Zoom:** Modify the overall size of the window and elements
(Dragging the 4 corner could only change the size of window)

**Address:** Input whatever you want, it is a text field

__Timer Box__

(The two timer boxes have the same features)

**Today's date**
Check: Display today's date
Un-check: Display a timer

**Title:** The title of the timer
**Date:** Change the end date of the timer
(correct format: [YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss],
bracket is not needed, only ONE SPACE between DD and hh)

**Starting Date:**
It changes speed of progress bar
(for example
Today is 1st of May, Start date is 1st of Jan, End date is 1st of Dec
The bar will be half finished.
Today is 1st of May, Start date is 1st of May, End date is 1st of Dec
The bar will be full.
The progress bar will drop in relative size of the time scale, hence,
the shorter between the distance of start and end, the faster the progress bar is.

NOTICE! The progress WON'T work if today's date is not yet the starting date
)

Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds are simple used to hide or display the corresponding field.

The today's date Days field display the day of the year
e.g., 3 of Feb = 34 (31 in Jan+3 in Feb)
